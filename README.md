‚öôÔ∏è Project: Hardware/Software Co-Design with RISC-V & FPGA

This project explores processor design, simulation, and testing using a RISC-V‚Äìlike architecture. It combines hardware description, software tooling, and automation scripts to run experiments on FPGA platforms.

The work includes:
	‚Ä¢	Building and simulating a simple processor architecture
	‚Ä¢	Running automated test suites and generating results
	‚Ä¢	Using Vivado scripts (.tcl) for FPGA synthesis and programming
	‚Ä¢	Automating compilation, simulation, and deployment via Makefiles and shell scripts


Requirements
	‚Ä¢	GNU Make
	‚Ä¢	RISC-V GCC toolchain
	‚Ä¢	Xilinx Vivado (for FPGA synthesis & programming)

Build & Run

To compile:

make

To run automated tests:

make autotest

To program FPGA (via Vivado):

make program

üß™ Tests
	‚Ä¢	autotest.res contains results from automated test execution
	‚Ä¢	gen_tests_mutants.sh allows generating mutant test variations

üìñ Learning Outcomes

This project provides hands-on experience with:
	‚Ä¢	Processor design and low-level software/hardware interaction
	‚Ä¢	Automating builds and tests for FPGA targets
	‚Ä¢	Using Vivado .tcl scripts for hardware synthesis and deployment
